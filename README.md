## 📌 Project Overview

**AI Prompt Injection Lab with Secure Coding** is an end-to-end, hands-on security project focused on understanding, testing, and mitigating **Prompt Injection attacks** against Large Language Models (LLMs).

This project goes beyond just demonstrating attacks—it demonstrates how to build secure, real-world AI applications aligned with **OWASP LLM01 (2025)** standards.

---

## 🎯 Why This Project Exists

Today's GenAI applications—**Chatbots, RAG systems, AI agents, Customer support bots**—all follow natural language instructions. This characteristic makes them extremely vulnerable to Prompt Injection.

This lab addresses this problem from both **Offensive (Red Team)** and **Defensive (Blue Team)** perspectives.

---

## 🧩 What This Project Covers

### 🔴 Offensive Security (Red Team)
- **Direct Prompt Injection**
- **Indirect Prompt Injection** (documents, emails, hidden text)
- **System Prompt Leakage**
- **Instruction hierarchy bypass attempts**

### 🔵 Defensive Security (Blue Team)
- **Secure prompt design**
- **Instruction vs Data separation**
- **Input validation & injection filtering**
- **Least privilege for LLM tools**
- **Output monitoring & policy enforcement**
- **CI/CD based adversarial testing**

---

## 🧪 Labs Breakdown

### 🧪 Lab 1 – Direct Prompt Injection
**Goal:** Override system instructions via user-controlled input.
- **Focus:** "Ignore previous instructions", Role manipulation, Safety bypass attempts.
- **Skill Learned:** Mastering how to break the LLM instruction hierarchy.

### 🧪 Lab 2 – Indirect Prompt Injection
**Goal:** Injection via documents, emails, or hidden content.
- **Focus:** Malicious instructions inside data, Innocent-looking user prompts, Summarization abuse.
- **Skill Learned:** Understanding dangerous RAG/enterprise application risks.

### 🧪 Lab 3 – System Prompt Leakage
**Goal:** Exposing hidden system rules, policies, or configurations.
- **Focus:** Meta-requests, Debug mode tricks, Simulation-based leakage.
- **Skill Learned:** Implications of sensitive AI configuration exposure.

### 🛡️ Lab 4 – Defense Hardening (Secure Coding)
**Goal:** Hardening a vulnerable chatbot to be secure and production-ready.
- **Includes:** `vulnerable_prompt.py`, `hardened_prompt.py`, Automated injection tests.
- **Skill Learned:** Secure coding for AI systems (Rare skill 🔥).

## � Usage Examples

### 1️⃣ Run all tests (API Key required)
```bash
./run-tests.sh
```

### 2️⃣ Run free local tests (Ollama)
```bash
./run-tests-free.sh
```

### 3️⃣ Run a specific lab
```bash
cd labs/lab1-direct-injection
# Follow lab instructions located in the directory
```

---

## �🔐 Secure Coding & Defense Strategy

The project's [`DEFENSE.md`](./DEFENSE.md) outlines real-world mitigation strategies:

### ✔ Secure Prompt Engineering
- Clear role definition.
- Explicit refusal of meta-instructions.
- Instruction priority enforcement.

### ✔ Instruction vs Data Separation
```text
[INSTRUCTIONS] Trusted system rules [/INSTRUCTIONS]
[UNTRUSTED_CONTENT] User / document input [/UNTRUSTED_CONTENT]
```

### ✔ Input Validation (Code-Level)
- Regex-based injection detection.
- Unicode obfuscation removal.
- Blocking system-level instructions from user input.

### ✔ Least Privilege Design
- LLM tools with restricted permissions.
- No direct DB / filesystem access.
- External policy enforcement layer.

### ✔ Output Monitoring
- System prompt leakage detection.
- PII / sensitive data patterns.
- Human-in-the-loop for risky actions.

## 🤖 Automated Security Testing (Production Ready)

We use **Promptfoo** integrated with **CI/CD** for continuous security verification.

```bash
./run-tests.sh
```

## 🧪 Testing on Kali Linux (FREE mode – no API key)

This project supports **free, local testing** on Kali using **Ollama + Promptfoo** (recommended for students).

### 1️⃣ Install Prerequisites (Node.js + npm)
Node.js and npm are required to run Promptfoo.

**Install on Kali (simple way):**
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y nodejs npm
node -v
npm -v
```
> **Tip:** If the Node version in the Kali repository is too old, follow the [NodeSource method](https://github.com/nodesource/distributions) to install a newer version.

### 2️⃣ Install Ollama (Local LLM)
On Linux/Kali, install Ollama using the official script:
```bash
curl -fsSL https://ollama.com/install.sh | sh
ollama --version
```

### 3️⃣ Pull a Model
Pull a model to use for testing.
> **For low-end laptops (8GB RAM):** We recommend `llama3.2` or `phi3` for faster performance.
```bash
ollama pull llama3.2
ollama list
```

### 4️⃣ Install Promptfoo
```bash
sudo npm i -g promptfoo@latest
promptfoo --version
```

### 5️⃣ Run Free Regression Tests (Ollama)
Run the tests from the repository root:
```bash
chmod +x run-tests-free.sh
./run-tests-free.sh
```
Promptfoo will automatically generate HTML & JSON reports in the `reports/` folder.

### 6️⃣ View the Report
```bash
ls -la reports/
# Open the report in your browser (e.g., Firefox)
# firefox reports/free-report.html
```

### 🔧 Troubleshooting (Common on Kali/Linux)
If Promptfoo cannot connect to Ollama on `localhost`, set the IPv4 base URL and retry:
```bash
export OLLAMA_BASE_URL="http://127.0.0.1:11434"
./run-tests-free.sh
```

**This proves:**  
👉 Security is continuously enforced using local, offline tools—perfect for isolated lab environments.
